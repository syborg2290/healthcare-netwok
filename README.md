A decentralized healthcare system using Hyper ledger Fabric would involve
creating a block chain network consisting of multiple nodes, each representing a different entity
in the healthcare ecosystem such as hospitals, laboratories, and insurance companies. These
nodes would be connected to one another and would communicate using the Hyper ledger
Fabric protocol. Each node would have its own copy of the block chain ledger, which would
be used to store and share information about patients, medical records, and other relevant data.
This information would be encrypted and stored on the ledger in a tamper-proof manner,
ensuring that it is secure and private. To ensure that only authorized parties have access to the
data, the system would use digital identities and smart contracts. Each entity would have a
unique digital identity, which would be used to authenticate them on the network. Smart
contracts would be used to enforce rules and regulations, such as ensuring that patient data is
only shared with authorized parties. In terms of the architecture, the decentralized healthcare
system could be built on top of a permissioned block chain network, where only authorized
parties can join the network and participate in the consensus process. A consensus mechanism
like PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance) could be used for maintaining the distributed
ledger. Overall, the use of Hyper ledger Fabric would provide a secure and private way for
healthcare entities to share and access patient data, while also ensuring compliance with
regulations and maintaining the privacy of patients.
